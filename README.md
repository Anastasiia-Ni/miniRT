# MiniRT

## About project: 
The goal of the program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. 

In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.

The supported these simple geometric object: sphere, cylinder, plane and paraboloid (for a bonus part of subject).

This program can apply translation and rotation transformations to objects, lights and cameras. Lighting control: spot brightness, hard shadows, background lighting (objects are never in total darkness). Implemented ambient and diffuse lighting, added specular reflection and color disruption: checkerboard.

The program is written in C language for macOS and thus needs the gcc compiler and standard C libraries to run.

## Installation:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Anastasiia-Ni/miniRT.git
$ cd miniRT
$ make
```

## Usage:

- `./miniRT path/scene.rt`    to render the scene.rt passed as a parameter

#### example:
- `./miniRT maps/16_planets.rt`

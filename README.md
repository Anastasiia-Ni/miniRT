# MiniRT

## About project: 
The goal of the program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. 
The supported these simple geometric object: sphere, cylinder, plane and paraboloid (for a bonus part of subject).
This program can apply translation and rotation transformations to objects, lights and cameras. Lighting control: spot brightness, hard shadows, background lighting (objects are never in total darkness). Implemented ambient and diffuse lighting, added specular reflection and color disruption: checkerboard.
The program is written in C language for macOS and thus needs the gcc compiler and standard C libraries to run.

## Index: 
- img contains a few *.jpg files generated by the program
- inc contains headers 
- libft contains the source code of my libft library, which is used in the program
- maps and maps_bonus contains *.rt files that describes scenes for rendering by the program
- src contains the source code of the program

## Installation:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Anastasiia-Ni/miniRT.git
$ cd miniRT
$ make
```

## Usage:

- `./miniRT path/scene.rt`    to render the scene.rt passed as a parameter

## example:
`./miniRT maps/16_planets.rt`

## Examples of scenes:

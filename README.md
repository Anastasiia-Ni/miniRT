# MiniRT

About project: 
The goal of the program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. 
The supported these simple geometric object: sphere, cylinder, plane and paraboloid (for a bonus part of subject).
This program can apply translation and rotation transformations to objects, lights and cameras. Lighting control: spot brightness, hard shadows, background lighting (objects are never in total darkness). Implemented ambient and diffuse lighting, added specular reflection and color disruption: checkerboard.
The program is written in C language for macOS and thus needs the gcc compiler and standard C libraries to run.

Index: 
- img contains a few *.jpg files generated by the program
- inc contains headers 
- libft contains the source code of my libft library, which is used in the program
- maps and maps_bonus contains *.rt files that describes scenes for rendering by the program
- src contains the source code of the program

Installation:
